1. In Agile/Scrum development, describe the role of the product owner.

```
The product owner acts as a representative for the customer. They communicate information back and forth between the team and the customer.

```

2. What are four artifacts defined by the Scrum process?

```
Product Backlog - List of required features for the end product.
Sprint Backlog - Set of Product Backlog items to be focused on for a specific sprint, as well as a plan to accomplish them.
Burn-Down Chart - Sum of the remaining work in a Sprint Backlog.
Increment - Sum of all completed Product Backlog items, both in the current sprint and previous ones.
```

3. In regards to user involvement, explain the difference between Agile methodologies and traditional/heavyweight methodologies.

```
There is constant communication with the user in Agile methodologies. In a traditional methodology, there would be little communication other than at the start of the project, when the user gives their requirements, and the end, when the user is given the product and makes sure that it is what they asked for. Agile favors being able to respond to a user's changing demands over following a set-in-stone plan. It values customer collaboration over negotiating a contract.

```

4. Why are very few requirements analysts entry-level engineers?

```
There are other aspects of development other than coding. It requires a knowledge of these other aspects which is something an entry-level engineer may not know.

```

5. When developing object-oriented use cases, what is an _actor_?

```
An actor is an external entity that interacts with the project. An actor will do a set of related actions to accomplish a goal; this sequence is called a use case.

```
